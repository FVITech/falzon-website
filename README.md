*Unpaid Wages and Overtime*:  Employers in South Florida have a reputation for failing to pay their employees the proper wages due to them.  Mr. Falzon has represented employees and deserving employers in all types of unpaid wages and overtime cases in state and federal court.  Whether your case is about minimum wage violations, unpaid wages and overtime, disputed commissions, bonuses or severance pay due to you Mr. Falzon will ensure that you are paid all monies owed to you by your employer.

*Severance Agreements*:    Many times employers will present employees that they have just terminated with a severance agreement for them to sign in exchange for a sum of money.  These agreements usually come with strings attached.  The employee must give up all their claims and legal rights in exchange for the money paid pursuant to that agreement.  You should not sign a severance agreement without having an attorney review both the agreement and the circumstances surrounding your dismissal.  Mr. Falzon will review your agreement, the circumstances of your dismissal and any potential causes of action that you may have against your employer and in many cases may be able to negotiate an enhanced severance payment.

*Workplace Discrimination*:  Florida is a right to work state which essentially means that you may be fired for any legal reason or no reason if you are not a member of a union, a public employee or have a written employment agreement.  However you may not be fired for a discriminatory reason - your race, color, sex, age, national origin, religion, marital status, the fact that you are pregnant, your sexual orientation or your gender identity.  Mr. Falzon is experienced in handling discrimination claims on behalf of employees at the federal, state and local level.

*Workplace Harassment*:    The law forbids sexual harassment and other forms of harassment whether you are being harassed because of your race, your sex, your sexual orientation or gender identity.  Whether your supervisor is taking action against you because of your refusal to agree to his or her sexual demands or making your work environment intolerable for other illegal reasons Mr. Falzon will represent your interests.

*LGBT Discrimination*:        The law has been developing rapidly in the field of LGBT rights.  LGBT employees can now seek redress for discrimination, harassment and retaliation by their employers based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.

*Retaliation and Whistleblower statutes*:    The law forbids an employer from taking adverse action against you because you complain about your employer's illegal conduct and activities.  Nor may an employer retaliate against an employee for making a worker's compensation claim or for complaining about discrimination and harassment.

*Family and Medical Leave Act and Disability Discrimination*:   The law guarantees certain employees the right to take unpaid time off work due to a personal illness or to care for a sick relative.  An employer may not interfere with an employee's right to Family and Medical leave and may not retaliate against an employee who asserts their legal rights under the law.  Furthermore if an employee has a recognized disability then an employer may not discriminate against the employee and must take affirmative steps to accommodate the employee's disability.  A disability be either physical or mental irrespective of whether the disability is long term or short term.
